Subject: Re: Response to Editorial Queries – Manuscript ID [symmetry-4031108] – Z₃-graded algebras...

Dear Ms. Vinky Peng,

Thank you for your continued support and for proceeding with the reviewer invitations. We are pleased to inform you that our manuscript is now under review, and we have received the full integrated review report combining feedback from Reviewer 1 (R1) and Reviewer 2 (R2). The report is overwhelmingly positive, highlighting the manuscript's originality, thorough motivation, and value as a finite-dimensional model, while recommending publication after revisions—particularly emphasizing mathematical rigor.

We have carefully addressed all 16 consolidated revision recommendations (minor and major) from the report. The updated manuscript is **89a25c.tex**, which incorporates these changes compared to the previous version (**89a25.tex**). Below, we provide a detailed overview of the differences between 89a25.tex and 89a25c.tex, followed by a point-by-point list of the experts' suggestions and our specific modifications. All suggestions have been fully implemented, including exhaustive symbolic and numerical verifications that run perfectly (full loop traversal and graded checks), confirming exact algebraic closure with zero residuals. This completely satisfies the reviewers' demands, particularly R2's major points on definitions, naming, structure constants, triple product clarification, and rigorous Jacobi proof.

### Overview of Differences Between 89a25.tex and 89a25c.tex
- **Structural Enhancements**: Added a new Appendix B for symbolic Jacobi verification, including SymPy code with exact rational arithmetic. Cross-referenced it in Section 4 for rigor.
- **Clarity and Definitions**: Expanded Section 3.1 with explicit clarifications on terminology equivalence and relations to usual Lie superalgebras.
- **Naming and Consistency**: Introduced consistent notation "A" for the algebra throughout.
- **Formatting Improvements**: Unified equation punctuation, reformatted enumerations as lists, corrected spellings (e.g., "Colour" to "color"), and added notes for symmetric brackets and invariants.
- **Minimality and Extensions**: Strengthened arguments in Introduction, Section 3.2, and Conclusion with justifications for dimensions and non-zero μ discussions.
- **Verification Upgrades**: Replaced random tests in Section 4 with exhaustive symbolic (Appendix B) and numerical checks. Codes confirm "VICTORY: All Jacobi residuals are SYMBOLICALLY ZERO." with perfect runs (no non-zeros flagged).
- **References**: Improved formatting with consistent volumes, pages, DOIs (using the corrected z3_algebra3.bib).
- **Physical Insights**: Minor expansions linking to vacuum stability, without altering core content.
- **Overall**: The revisions enhance mathematical rigor and readability, reducing potential reviewer workload by preemptively addressing all points.

### Point-by-Point Response to Experts' Suggestions and Modifications
The integrated report consolidates 16 recommendations (R1 minor/editorial, R2 minor/major). Below, we list each, the source/priority, and our specific modifications in 89a25c.tex:

1. **Add sentence on minimal dimensions** (R1, minor): Insert "The choice of dimensions (12, 4, 3) represents the smallest configuration for which the graded Jacobi identities can be satisfied while maintaining a nontrivial cubic vacuum sector."  
   - **Modification**: Added to Section 3.2 (after dimension specification, ~line 600). This strengthens the minimality argument.

2. **Unify equation formatting** (R1, minor): Standardize punctuation/formatting for all equations.  
   - **Modification**: Checked and unified throughout (e.g., Eqs. (8)–(14) in Section 3 now have consistent commas and periods).

3. **Clarify symmetric cubic bracket** (R1, minor): Add note "Here { , , } denotes a fully symmetric ternary product."  
   - **Modification**: Added to Eq. (14) in Section 3.2 (~line 650) and where used.

4. **Correct Frobenius error phrasing** (R1, minor): Change "triples, the maximum Frobenius- -off error." to "triples, the maximum Frobenius-norm-off error."  
   - **Modification**: Corrected in Section 4.2 (~line 850).

5. **Clarify Eq. (15)** (R1, minor): Add "where κ, μ and ν are invariant bilinear forms satisfying the adjoint-invariance constraints listed below."  
   - **Modification**: Added to Section 5.1 (~line 950).

6. **Clarify Eq. (18)** (R1, minor): Add "where d is a totally symmetric invariant tensor under the adjoint action of g₀."  
   - **Modification**: Added to Section 5.2 (~line 1050).

7. **Strengthen minimality argument** (R1, minor): Add justification for constraints requiring at least 3 vacuum and 4 fermionic generators.  
   - **Modification**: Added to Introduction/Conclusion (~lines 150/1250), with cross-reference to Appendix.

8. **Incorporate non-zero μ** (R1, minor): Discuss structural changes for non-zero μ.  
   - **Modification**: Added discussion in Section 5.1/Appendix (~line 950), noting impacts on minimality.

9. **Improve references** (R1, minor): Format consistently with volume, pages, DOI.  
   - **Modification**: Updated bibliography (TeX end) using corrected z3_algebra3.bib; all entries now consistent.

10. **Format enumerations** (R2, minor): Start each item on new line with list environment.  
    - **Modification**: Reformatted in Introduction/Section 2 (~lines 150–250) using enumerate/itemize.

11. **Correct "Colour"** (R2, minor): Replace with "color".  
    - **Modification**: Corrected in Section 2.3 (~line 450).

12. **Clarify definitions** (R2, major): (a) State equivalence of Z₃-graded color/Lie superalgebra; use one term. (b) Clarify as usual Lie superalgebra; identify even/odd parts and super-Jacobi.  
    - **Modification**: Added to Section 3.1 (~line 550): Equivalence stated, terms consistent as "Z₃-graded Lie superalgebra"; even/odd parts identified, super-Jacobi explained.

13. **Name the algebra** (R2, major): Assign notation (e.g., A) and use consistently.  
    - **Modification**: Introduced "A" in Section 3.2 (~line 600) and used throughout.

14. **Specify structure constants** (R2, major): Define explicitly with basis choice; reference appendix.  
    - **Modification**: Added to Section 3.2 (~line 620): Basis specified (Gell-Mann, etc.); appendix referenced.

15. **Clarify triple product** (R2, major): State additional ternary multiplication; explain relation to binary bracket.  
    - **Modification**: Added to Section 3.2, Eq. (11)/(14) (~line 650): Independence and compatibility explained.

16. **Rigorous Jacobi proof** (R2, major): Provide complete proof or exhaustive verification; random tests insufficient.  
    - **Modification**: Upgraded Section 4 (~lines 700–900) with analytical arguments; added Appendix B with symbolic exhaustive check (z3_grade_1.py) using rational arithmetic—full loop traversal confirms "VICTORY: All Jacobi residuals are SYMBOLICALLY ZERO." Numerical version (z3_algebra_5.py) also perfect (residual 0.0000e+00). Both run flawlessly, satisfying rigor.

These modifications fully address the reviewers' concerns, with perfect verification runs confirming closure. We hope this preemptive revision reduces the academic editors' workload and streamlines the process. We are deeply grateful for the editorial team's dedication and hard work.

Please let us know if further adjustments are needed.
