"Please note: The UFO model introduces the effective ternary couplings derived from the algebra. While a standard fixed-order MG5 run will correctly reproduce the inclusive cross-section enhancement (
σ_total
), reproducing the exact lineshape near the 
2m_t
 threshold requires treating the ternary exchange as a modification to the static potential in your NRQCD resummation framework (or simply rescaling the K-factor in the threshold bin), rather than a pure Breit-Wigner resonance search."
