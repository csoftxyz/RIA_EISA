* == About My Research Attitude ==  
I have great respect for scholars in string theory, quantum gravity and related fields. The theoretical systems built through decades of work represent invaluable achievements of human intellect.  
In proposing the EISA-RIA theory, I don't seek to challenge anyone or overthrow existing frameworks. As an independent researcher, I'm fully aware this work may never gain mainstream acceptance.  
But understanding reality's essence is my personal quest. Even if future experimental evidence fully supports this theory, I won't engage in academic debates—because I sincerely respect the dedication every scholar has poured into their models.  
My goal is simple: to verify my understanding of the cosmos in my own way. This has nothing to do with awards, positions, or recognition. It's just one individual's humble tribute to truth.

Our initial idea, that quantum fluctuation lifting/dropping dynamics couple with curvature to generate gravitational effects, originated from our previous research. A related paper has now been published in the Proceedings of SPIE.: https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/conference-proceedings-of-spie/13705/1370524/Towards-a-unified-framework-of-transient-quantum-dynamics--integrating/10.1117/12.3070369.short

## About My Research Attitude
## Overview  
This repository provides seven PyTorch-based numerical simulations supporting the Extended Integrated Symmetry Algebra (EISA) augmented by Recursive Info-Algebra (RIA) framework, as detailed in the manuscript "Recursive Algebra in Extended Integrated Symmetry: An Effective Framework for Quantum Field Dynamics" (LaTeX source: 71a8b.tex), submitted for consideration to Entropy as part of a PhD dissertation. These simulations validate key theoretical predictions, including self-organization from chaos via entropy minimization, transient fluctuations inducing curvature feedback and phase transitions, particle mass hierarchies and fundamental constants from irrep branching, cosmological evolution resolving Hubble tension with multi-messenger signatures, superalgebra closure, universe modeling on grids, and inverse CMB fitting.  
Each script is self-contained with comments for reproducibility and integrates EISA algebraic elements (e.g., generators \(F_i\), \(B_k\) for bosonic/fermionic sectors) with RIA recursion (VQC-optimized loss involving Von Neumann entropy \(S_{vn}\) and fidelity). Simulations approximate EFT dynamics below the Planck scale, with uncertainties ~10-20% due to simplifications (e.g., 4x4-64x64 matrices). Outputs quantify observables like entropy reduction (~40.2% average, std <1% across runs), GW frequencies (10^{17} to 10^{-16} Hz), mass ratios (~10^5), and H_0 values (~73 km/s/Mpc vs. Planck 67.4).  
To ensure numerical precision for PhD-level scrutiny and peer review, simulations were executed on CPU platforms with ECC memory to mitigate bit errors, maintaining floating-point consistency. Execution times are under 1 hour per 1000 iterations on standard hardware (e.g., Intel i7, 32GB RAM). Outputs encompass console metrics, plots, and logs, all preserved for peer review.
