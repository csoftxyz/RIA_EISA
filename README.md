## Overview

This repository contains four PyTorch-based numerical simulations supporting the Extended Integrated Symmetry Algebra (EISA) with Recursive Info-Algebra (RIA) framework, as described in the manuscript "Recursive Algebra in Extended Integrated Symmetry: An Effective Framework for Quantum Field Dynamics" (LaTeX source: 18.tex). These simulations validate key theoretical predictions, including self-organization from chaos via entropy minimization, transient fluctuations inducing curvature feedback and phase transitions, particle mass hierarchies and fundamental constants from irrep branching, and cosmological evolution resolving Hubble tension with multi-messenger signatures.

Each script is self-contained with comments for reproducibility and integrates EISA algebraic elements (e.g., generators \(F_i\), \(B_k\) for bosonic/fermionic sectors) with RIA recursion (VQC-optimized loss involving Von Neumann entropy \(S_{vn}\) and fidelity). Simulations approximate EFT dynamics below Planck scale, with uncertainties ~10-20% due to simplifications (e.g., 4x4-8x8 matrices). Outputs quantify observables like entropy reduction (~30.6%), GW frequencies (~10^{10} Hz), mass ratios (~10^5), and H_0 values (~73 km/s/Mpc vs. Planck 67.4).

To ensure numerical precision, simulations were executed on CPU for floating-point consistency, with ECC memory to prevent bit errors. Execution times are <1 hour per 1000 iterations on standard hardware (e.g., Intel i7, 32GB RAM). Outputs include console metrics, plots, and logs.
